## _Udacity Nanodegree Program_

The project is for the [Data Scientist Udacity Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

This project entails three key steps:

- Selecting a dataset;
- Identifying three questions; and
- Answering those questions through data analysis.

The project is built with Python version 3 using Jupyter Notebook. It is also recommended to install two additional library scikit-learn by using the two command below within your Jupyter Notebook.

```
pip install seaborn
pip install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

The project is based on the following structure:

- analysis.ipynb. is a python program built using Jupyter notebook; it includes the code used for data analysis
- Boston_listings.csv. includes data retrieved from Kaggle Boston Airbnb Open Data.
- Boston_reviews.csv. includes data retrieved from Boston Airbnb Open Data.

## Instructions to Run the Project

Step 1:
You must install Jupyter Notebook on your device prior to starting the project. If you donâ€™t already have it, you can do so here: Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Step 2:
You will need to ensure you have the following packages available as part of Anaconda:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Step 3:
You can download the data from the Kaggle datasets page. That link is included here:
[Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston). You will need to put them in the same folder as the python analysis code.

## Project Motivation

The key motivations for this project are captured in the following questions:

1. What area is most popular during the graduation season, particularly in Boston?
2. To what extent, if any, do prices vary over the course of year? Seasonally? How do prices fluctuate, if at all, by month?
3. Does the price fluctuate based on parking availability or other amenities?
